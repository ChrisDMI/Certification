### Project 🚧
One of the main pain points that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages. AT&T has been manually flagging spam messages for some time, but they are seeking an automated way to detect and protect their users from spams.

### Goals 🎯
The goal in this project is to build a spam detector that can automatically flag incoming messages as spam based solely on their content.

### Scope of this project 🖼️
To begin the project, AT&T has provided you with a dataset that you should use for training and evaluation. You can find the dataset in `src/`folder.
