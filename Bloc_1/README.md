### Plan your trip with Kayak 

The Kayak Marketing Team has initiated a new project to address the needs of their users who are planning trips. Through user research, it was discovered that 70% of users express a desire for more information about their destination before traveling. Additionally, users tend to question the credibility of information if they are unfamiliar with the brand providing it. To meet these user needs and establish credibility, the team aims to develop an application that recommends ideal holiday destinations based on real-time data regarding weather conditions and available hotels in the area. The application will utilize the following variables: 

* Weather information  
* Hotel availability.

The primary goals of this project involve collecting the necessary data and building the infrastructure to support the application. Since the project is in its initial stages, there is no existing data available. As a result, your responsibilities will include: 

* Scraping data from various destinations 
* Gathering weather data for each destination 
* Obtaining information about hotels in each destination 
* Storing all collected information in a data lake  
* Extracting, transforming, and loading the cleaned data from the data lake to a data warehouse


### Methodology

To achieve this project, marketing team wants to focus first on the best cities to travel to in France that can be found from this web site One Week In.com.

Weather data will be get from APIs:
* Use nominatim to get the gps coordinates of all the cities (no subscription required)
* Use openweathermap (you have to subscribe to get a free apikey)
