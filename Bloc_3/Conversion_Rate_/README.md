* Generate actionable recommendations for improving conversion rates.

### Dataset ðŸ“Š
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about website visitors, including various features such as user demographics, browsing behavior, and historical data. The dataset has been collected from a real-world online business and has been preprocessed for the purpose of this challenge.
