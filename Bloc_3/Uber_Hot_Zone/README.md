## Uber Hot-Zones Recommendation Project

### Company's Description 📇
Uber is a globally recognized startup that revolutionized transportation with its ride-sharing application. What started as a solution for affordable transportation has now expanded to various services, including food delivery through Uber Eats, package delivery, freight transportation, and urban transportation with Jump Bike and Lime (funded by Uber).

Uber's mission is to transform transportation worldwide. Operating in approximately 70 countries and 900 cities, Uber generates over $14 billion in revenue!

### Project 🚧
Uber's data team has identified a significant pain point: the unavailability of drivers in specific areas when users need them the most. For instance, users located in San Francisco's Financial District may struggle to find an available Uber driver, while drivers might be predominantly concentrated in the Castro area.

To address this issue, Uber wants to develop a feature within their app that recommends hot-zones in major cities, indicating the best areas for drivers to be present at any given time of the day.

### Goals 🎯
Your goal is to create algorithms that determine the hot-zones where Uber drivers should be located in major cities. Specifically, you will:

* Develop an algorithm to identify hot-zones based on Uber's pickup data.
* Visualize the results on an intuitive and informative dashboard.

### Scope of this project 🖼️
To kickstart the project, Uber has chosen to focus on implementing this feature in New York City. Therefore, the project's scope is limited to analyzing Uber trip data specifically for New York City.

The dataset is provided on `src/`folder.

Please note that your analysis and algorithms should focus solely on New York City's data.
