## Walmart Sales Prediction

### Company's Description 
Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores across the United States. The company, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

### Project
Walmart's marketing service has requested the development of a machine learning model capable of estimating the weekly sales in their stores with high precision. The objective is to understand how sales are influenced by economic indicators and utilize the model to plan future marketing campaigns effectively.

### Goals
The project can be divided into three main steps:

* `Part 1`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and necessary preprocessing to prepare the data for machine learning.

* `Part 2`: Train a linear regression model as the baseline for sales prediction.

* `Part 3`: Implement a regularized regression model to avoid overfitting and enhance prediction accuracy.


### Scope of this project
In this project, you will work with a dataset containing information about the weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, along with other variables such as the unemployment rate and fuel prices. These variables can be used to predict the sales amount accurately. The dataset has been sourced from a Kaggle competition, but some modifications have been made to tailor it specifically for this project.
