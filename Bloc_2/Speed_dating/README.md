## Speed Dating EDA

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a speed dating dataset with the goal of predicting whether someone has a chance to go on a second date. The dataset contains information about participants' demographics, interests, ratings of attractiveness, and whether or not they exchanged contact information with another participant.

### Data

The speed dating dataset used in this project contains information about participants' demographics, interests, ratings of attractiveness, and whether or not they exchanged contact information with another participant. The dataset can be found in the `src` folder of this repository and is named `speed_dating.csv`. A data dictionary that describes the variables in the dataset can be found in the same folder and is named `data_dictionary.csv`.

### Methodology

The EDA process for this project involved the following steps:

`Data Cleaning`: The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis by removing irrelevant or missing data, standardizing data types, and dealing with any outliers or inconsistencies.

`Data Exploration`: The cleaned data was analyzed to identify relevant variables, correlations, and patterns in the data. This involved visualizing the data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, and calculating summary statistics.

`Feature Selection`: The most relevant features for the analysis were selected based on their importance in predicting the likelihood of a second date. This involved using statistical tests such as t-tests and ANOVA to determine which variables were most significantly associated with the outcome variable.

### Results

The key findings of the EDA process are as follows:

Participants who rated their partners higher in attractiveness and shared interest were more likely to go on a second date.

Participants who place great importance on shared interests will want to go on a second date when they find that he shares the same interests with the partner. What is not the case for attractiveness.

Race, religion or income were not significant predictors of whether or not someone would go on a second date.

It is very difficult for people to accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market.

In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night.

### Conclusion

Based on the findings of this EDA process, it appears that attractiveness, shared interests are the most important factors in predicting whether someone has a chance to go on a second date. These findings can be used to inform the design of future speed dating events and improve their success rates.
